# AppIdentifiers per User data file
#
# Sample input file for the the AddUsers and RemoveUsers utilities. For AddUsers,
# this type of input file is only used in -app-identifiers-per-user-file mode. 
#
# This file specifies a list of AppIdentifiers per user. For that user, the utility
# will grant/remove access to applications associated with those AppIdentifiers.
#
# The add user utility runs in this mode when you include on the command line:
#	-app-identifiers-per-user-file <AppIdentifiers per username data filename>
#
# Format of each non-comment line in this file: a user's username, followed by one or more
# AppIdentifiers. Fields are separated with a semicolon (;).
#
# For example, if you want to grant access to AppIdentifier 123 for user a123456, you
# would include the following line:
#	a123456;123
# To grant access to AppIdentifier 123 and AppIdentifier 456 for user a123456, you
# would include the following line:
#	a123456;123;456
# You can include any number of AppIdentifiers on a line (as long as they are separated
# with semicolons).
#
# Comment lines (lines that start with #) and blank/empty lines are ignored.
