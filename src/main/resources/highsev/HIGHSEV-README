Summary:

Looks through every single catalog component and attempts the following:

1) Looks though all vulnerabilities
2) If more than one vulnerability exists, determines the highest severity.
3) Assigns this severity to a custom attribute specified by the user.
4) If no vulnerabilities exist, resets the custom attribute to a blank value.

Execution:

- Create a highsev.properties with the required Code Center credential (use provided example)
- Specify the 'highsev.custom.attribute.name' with the name of the attribute.
- Run the batch/shell script with the argument: -config [location of your config file]
